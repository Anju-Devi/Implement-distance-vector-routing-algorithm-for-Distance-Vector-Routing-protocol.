# Implement-distance-vector-routing-algorithm-for-Distance-Vector-Routing-protocol.
A distance-vector routing (DVR) protocol requires that a router inform its neighbors of topology changes periodically. Historically known as the old ARPANET routing algorithm (or known as Bellman-Ford algorithm).  Bellman Ford Basics – Each router maintains a Distance Vector table containing the distance between itself and ALL possible destination nodes. Distances,based on a chosen metric, are computed using information from the neighbors’ distance vectors.  Information kept by DV router - Each router has an ID Associated with each link connected to a router,  there is a link cost (static or dynamic). Intermediate hops  Distance Vector Table Initialization - Distance to itself = 0 Distance to ALL other routers = infinity number.
